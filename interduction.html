            Hi i am Rikan . <br>
            <br>Here i would be uploading all the challanges i am facing learing cyber Security <br>
            <br>This will be a well documented journey as i think , in my past i have never gone for a <br>
            <br>documented journey while learing somethig but this time i am trying this as someone else can <br>
            <br> also get help from me . By the way thanks for being a part of this journey , today is 3rd sept 2019.
            <br>
            <br> and my journey starts from here <br>

        </p>

        <h2>
            Introduction to the services

        </h2>
        <p>
            In introduction to the kali interface , you will notice a ton of tools which will help you to <br>
            <br>breach the Security <br>
            <br> The <code>ssh </code> and <code>apache2</code> are works as the sevices <br>
            <br> They are located as in the <code>/usr/bin/</code> <br>
            <br> The files are in the format of <code>.d </code>i.e <i class="e">demon format </i> <br>
            <br> For example <code>/usr/bin/ssh.d</code> <br>
            <br>To start the service or Demons the following commands are used <br>
            <br><code>
                systemctl service_name start/stop/restart/enable/disable
                service service_name start/stop/restart/enable/disable 

            </code>
            <br> The above commmands can be remembered by <b>system control then service name followed by what you want
                to do </b>
            <ol>

                <li>Example <code>service ssh start</code></li>

                <li>Example <code>systemctl ssh start</code></li>
            </ol>


        </p>
        <p>
            The other way is to make a boot presistance while booting the system
            <br>that can be done by the file <code>updat-rc.d</code>file,below is one example <br>
            <br><i>lets assume i want ssh to be started while system boots up </i>
            <br> The command for that will be <br>
            <br> <code>update-rc.d enble ssh</code>
            <br> For disabling it while start up the following code can be used <br>
            <br> <code> updat-rc.d disable ssh </code>
        </p>



        <h2>
            Bash Shell commands and scripts
        </h2>
        <p>
            <br> Bash Shell is the terminal window what you will be using in kali for most of the time as its <br>
            <br> the built in shell in kali machine . This usally codeed using <b>C language </b> for faster execution
            of codes <br>
            <br>Here i am concidering that you know a little bit about commands of linux <br>

            <h3>Some of the basic commands </h3>
            <br>some basic commands are follows which will help to locate file directory ,files in the directory. <br>
            <ol>
                <li><code>locate </code>:locate command is used to find where the file is located in the linux file
                    system</li>
                <li><code>find</code>:find is also used for the same purpose as locate and its bit slow as its serch
                    entire directories </li>
                <li><code>which </code>:which commmand is used to find the path of the file </li>
            </ol>


        </p>

        <h2>syntax and use of some useful commandlines </h2>
        <p>
            <br> some of the syntax are given below for the above commands <br>
            <code>
                <i>find {directory} [option ] filename</i> <br> <b> find / -name sbd.exe</b> </code>
            <br>:it means find in the
            root directories a file named as sbd.exe <br>





        </p>
        <p>
            <b> locate command works quickly as its linked to the the data base built in for file system of linux
                os </b>the command to uppdate the data base manually is <code> updatedb</code>
        </p>

        <h2>bash scripting (one sample)</h2>
        <p>
            Bash scripting can be very useful and handy to automate simple tasks <br>
            <br>for example to see the sub domain ips by itterting one by one url <br>
            <br> in a txt file can be done through a simple bash script as follows <br>
            <code>
               <br> #!/bin/bash <br>

            
               <br> for url in $(cat filename.txt );
                <br> do 
                <br> host url |grep "address has " |cut -d "space' -f4 
                <br> done



            </code>
            <br> open your favorite text editor like <b>emacs , nano, vi</b>and punch in the codes and see the magic
            <br> try to write the script for the ping coomand to ping a network range <br>
            <br> also give a try to write a script for saving a page of a website as a parameter and extract its all
            subdomin and their ips <br>
